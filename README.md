# Web-Scraping-Projects

Web Scraping 1:
This script serves as an introductory project in web scraping, utilizing the pytube library to interact with YouTube. After installing pytube3, the script prompts the user to input a YouTube video link. It then creates an instance of the YouTube class with this link, enabling the extraction of various details about the video, such as its title, view count, duration, description, rating, and likes. Additionally, the script identifies and downloads the highest resolution version of the video, providing a completion message upon successful download. This project effectively demonstrates how to use Python for web scraping and data extraction from an online service.
