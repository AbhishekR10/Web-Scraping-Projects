This script serves as an introductory project in web scraping, utilizing the pytube library to interact with YouTube. After installing pytube3, the script prompts the user to input a YouTube video link. It then creates an instance of the YouTube class with this link, enabling the extraction of various details about the video, such as its title, view count, duration, description, rating, and likes. Additionally, the script identifies and downloads the highest resolution version of the video, providing a completion message upon successful download. This project effectively demonstrates how to use Python for web scraping and data extraction from an online service.

This script demonstrates web scraping with the twint library to gather Twitter followings data. After installing twint, it defines a list of notable users and a function to scrape their followings. The script iterates over each user, storing followings in a dictionary and compiling a combined list. It then uses Counter to identify the top 10 most common followings among these users. Additionally, it creates a dictionary to track mutual follow relationships, constructing a DataFrame to visualize these relationships. This project highlights the use of Python for web scraping and data analysis, focusing on Twitter interactions.
